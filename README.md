# Portfolio

This project is Gatsby application for my personal portfolio. I have attempted to create portfolio websites in the past using plain HTML & CSS, and React, but I have decided to start from scratch using Gatsby to use the benefits from the framework. This website also uses Prismic to store the data and GraphQL for data fetching. This project is still a work-in-progress as the designs are still undergoing wireframing in Figma to reflect design principles that I have learned in my design classes.
